### Edit your life ruthlessly,it's your masterpiece after all. source :J.L

i came across this quote not too long ago and it really resonated with me. 

One should always seek to innovate and improve on the current condition.
### How?

Well, look within and make a list of your pain points and begin to chip at them one at a time. You probably cannot get from A to Z in a jiffy but you can always get from A to B, always!



### _Do it afraid,don't waste time trying to overcome fear.Peace :)_
